you are cells your muscles organs skin

and hair they are in your blood and in

your bones

cells are biological robots they don't

want anything they don't feel anything

they are never sad or happy they just

are right here right now they're as

conscious as a stone or a chair or a

neutron star

s just follow their programming that's

been evolving and changing for billions

of years molded by natural selection

they are impossible machines and yet

here they are driven entirely by the

fundamental forces of the universe the

smallest unit of life right at the

border where physics becomes biology

sometimes to get a truer understanding

of how amazing something is you need to

hold your breath and dive in really deep

so what are cells and how do they work

[Music]

around the room you're sitting in right

now let's fill it top to bottom with

trillions of grains of sand billions of

grains of rice hundreds of thousands of

grapes a few thousand apples and a dozen

watermelons this is what the inside of

your cells looks like

in terms of numbers they're mostly

filled up with water molecules the

grains of sand

water gives the cells insides the

consistency of soft jelly and enables

other things to move around easily

almost all the other things the rice and

fruit are proteins several billion in

total more than 10 000 different kinds

depending on the function of the cell

your cells are basically protein robots

as is all life really

in fact all solid non-fat parts of your

body are mostly made out of protein even

your bones

proteins are dead things that make life

happen

how does this work

the language of life

cells need to do many very hard things

to stay alive get food in and waste out

grow and build structures Escape danger

or react to stimuli make copies of

themselves and so on all of this is done

by speaking the language of life and the

words of this language are proteins this

is how this language Works in a nutshell

it all begins with amino acids tiny

organic molecules

they're the alphabet of the language of

life there are 21 different ones like

different letters

amino acid a amino acid b c and so on

if you put around 50 amino acids

together they form a protein which in

the language of life is a word and if

you put many of these protein words

together you get a sentence called a

biological pathway

let's oversimplify a bit and say for

example your cell needs to break down

sugar with the language of life it may

take the amino acids for the letters b r

e a and K to form the protein word break

then combine this word with other

protein words to form a biological

pathway sentence that means break down

sugar

in reality this language of life is so

complex that it defies imagination you

need to know about 8 000 words to speak

a human language really well but in the

language of life there are an estimated

twenty thousand and while the average

English word has five letters human

proteins have an average of 375 amino

acids the longest protein has more than

thirty thousand

and cells need to execute thousands of

steps at any moment if they ever stop

speaking the language of Life they die

okay but how do Mindless cells speak a

language this complex

let's dive a little deeper

there are 21 amino acids that can be

combined to form proteins

and proteins are made up of dozens to

hundreds to thousands of amino acids for

the average protein length of a human

cell of 375 amino acids you get a

stunning 6.8 times 10 to the power of

495 possible proteins your cells can

make a quadrillion Google Google Google

times more than there are atoms in the

universe

most of these possible proteins are

useless just like with human language

most random letter combinations are just

gibberish so you need to know which

words which proteins make up a language

to speak it properly

and this is the job of your DNA a long

sequence of instructions

if you untangle the cell's DNA it would

be about two meters long all of your

body's DNA combined into one long string

would reach to the Sun and back over 20

times

around one percent of your DNA is made

up of genes which are basically protein

dictionaries that contain all the words

of the language of Life your cells speak

but genes are also the building manuals

for all the proteins your cells need to

function

the rest of your DNA is probably not

useless but basically like a set of

rules it's like the book of grammar of

the language of Life which proteins need

to be built at which time how many of

them do you need which protein words go

together and why

okay letters words sentences dictionary

and grammar but of course this is all

just a metaphor for something

mind-numbingly complex let's dive a

little deeper to catch a glimpse of

reality

how dead proteins make life

now that we have some basic principles

we have a chance to understand how dead

things make life together and for that

we need a fundamental force of the

universe electromagnetism

the elementary particles that make up

atoms which make up amino acids have

different charges that attract or repair

each other the 21 different amino acids

all have slightly different charges

some are more negative others more

positive

when your cells build proteins they put

different amino acids together in Chains

basically long strings now because of

the different charges of the amino acids

used these strings begin to fold in on

themselves

this folding process is so complex that

we still haven't completely understood

how exactly it works but in a nutshell

1D strings become 3D structures

proteins are basically 3D puzzle pieces

with a very specific shape in the world

of proteins shape is everything because

its 3D shape determines which areas of a

protein are charged in which way and

this determines how it can interact with

other proteins

all of these differently charged puzzle

pieces can snap together or repeat each

other

when they snap together their charge

changes which can make them change their

shape which then makes them a new

protein a new tool that can do new

things this is what makes proteins so

incredibly powerful you can do basically

everything with them they can snap

together like Lego pieces to build

complex structures they can dismantle

things they can form complex micro

machines that use energy to do work and

maybe most stunningly they can convey

information let's say there's a toxic

chemical entering your cell there may be

a protein shaped to snap to that toxin

if the protein finds that toxin it

changes its shape with that new shape it

can now snap into a different protein

that changes its shape again this new

protein activates a micro machine that

directly binds to your DNA to order the

production of a special protein which

acts as an antidote to the toxin

this Cascade of interaction is the

pathway we spoke about earlier a

sentence in the language of life

so without a single active thought

proteins have fixed a problem and saved

the cell's life in reality these

Pathways can have dozens to hundreds of

steps

life operates is so incredibly orange

using

somehow mind-numbingly complex

interactions between dumb and dead

proteins create a less dumb and less

dead cell

somewhere around here life happens but

we still don't know what life is

how dumb things are smart together

we need another analogy so let's talk

about ants ants share a fundamental

property with cells they are really dumb

a single ant will just stumble around

uselessly but if you put a lot of ants

together they exchange information and

do amazing things constructing complex

structures organizing themselves caring

for Broods or attacking enemies

although dumb individually together they

become something greater this phenomenon

occurs all over nature and is called

emergence it's the observation that

entities have properties and abilities

that their parts do not have

this is how everything in your body

works your cells are bags of proteins

Guided by chemistry but together these

proteins form a living being that can do

a lot of really sophisticated things

cells are Mindless robots that are even

dumber than ants but many of them acting

together form specialized tissue and

organ systems from muscles that make

your heartbeat to brain cells that make

you think

if you look outside at the incredible

Dimension and scale of space a place

where forever is a real thing it's

almost impossible not to feel a bit

small not special but if you look inside

into what you really are you just

discover almost Indescribable complexity

the beautiful language of life

almost everything in the universe

reveals hidden layers of complexity if

you look closer and if you have the

knowledge to understand it to help you

with that
